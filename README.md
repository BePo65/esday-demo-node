# esday-demo-node
This is a minimal demo for how to use the [esday](https://github.com/g-mero/esday) library in a node script. It simply displays the current date and a date in 5 days.

To run the script go to the script directory and simply use `node index.js`.  
The script the writes 3 lines with the current and a future date to the console.
